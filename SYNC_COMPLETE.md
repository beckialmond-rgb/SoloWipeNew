## 🧹 Optional: Clean Up Helper Files

You have some helper files that were created during setup. You can:

### Option 1: Keep them (useful for future)
These files can be helpful if you need to push again later.

### Option 2: Remove them
If you want to clean up:

```bash
# Remove helper scripts and docs
rm push-only.sh push-simple.sh push-to-github.sh
rm EXACT_COMMAND.md PUSH_FINAL.md READY_TO_PUSH.md SIMPLE_PUSH.md
rm COMPLETE_PUSH_STEPS.md EASY_PUSH.md PUSH_INSTRUCTIONS.md PUSH_NOW.md
rm COMMIT_AUDIT_REPORT.md SYNC_STATUS.md SYNC_COMPLETE.md
```

### Option 3: Commit them
If you want to keep them in the repository:

```bash
git add push-only.sh push-simple.sh *.md
git commit -m "Add helper scripts and documentation"
git push origin main
```
